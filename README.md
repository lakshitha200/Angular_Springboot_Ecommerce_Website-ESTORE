# ECommerce Application (ESTORE)

I developed an eCommerce application allowing users to browse and purchase products across five distinct categories. 
This is a front-end part of my full-stack E-Commerce Application. Back-end part was developed using Spring Boot.

__Technologies Used__: Spring Boot, Angular, MySQL

__Key functionalities include__:
* User can view product list, product detatils and specifications.
* User authentication with sign-in and sign-up capabilities. (Using Jwt and Spring Security)
* Adding products to a shopping cart or wishlist.
* Filtering products by categories.
* Updating user account details.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.
